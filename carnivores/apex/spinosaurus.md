### Homosexual Behavior: 
None, only mating/court with the oposite gender
### Maternal Bond:
Mothers have a very tight bond with their calves that can never be broken. Mothers will protect her calves until she dies. To give the calves the best chance spinos will form breeding ‘swarms’. In Spring, some males will want to attract more females, and others will mate for life. Males that are in monogamous relationships will help raise their young to adulthood, while males in polygamous relationships will leave the females to raise the calves by herself.
### Early Life: 
Whelps are born defenseless and do not leave their mothers nest. Calves are 100% dependent on their mothers. Never leaving her side, they rely on her for everything, safety, warmth, food, and companionship. Should a calve have a sibling, those two will fight to decide who is more dominant. Mothers will try their best to separate these fights. The most dominant sibling will eat first, get more attention from their mother, and sometimes will be allowed to follow their mother should the most dominant sibling be female. 
### Solo Behavior:
Most of the lone spinos are male. These males are HIGHLY cannibalistic, and will cull any spino smaller than them. Solos tend to want to stick to 1 bigger body of water, moving around can lead to death very easily. Spinos tend to use water to their advantage, but are also very bold hunters and do not use water so much when it comes to protection.
### Hierarchy: 
None, All are equal
### Mating: 
Males will begin calling around their body of water in their territory. He will make small kills around the body of water and dance with his head held high in the water. Should a female hear his calls and come to investigate, she will inspect the kills he has made and will watch his dance. Should she like his display, she will eat his meals, and will begin dancing with him in the water. Should they both court successfully, the female will choose a place to place her nest. The male if he wishes to be monogamous will remain with the female and help protect and raise the young. Should he want to be polygamous he will being calling out in hopes to attract more females.
### Locations Spinos can be found in: 
Around large bodies of water, and in areas opens for basking
