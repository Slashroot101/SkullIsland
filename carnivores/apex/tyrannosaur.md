### Adoption:
Tyrannasaurus is not able to adopt. Males and Females only want to take care of their own offspring
### Homosexual Behavior:
None, only mating/courting with the oposite gender
### Maternal Bond:
|Mother will protect her cubs with her life, and will remain with her cubs until they reach adulthood. During this time, the mother will never let her young out of her sight, and will not take a mate during this time. Fathers are not involved with raising the young, but will often stick around on the outskirts of the female's territory while the cubs are still young to provide safety and small meals. During this time the male and female can still hunt together, and protect each other, but as soon as the cubs reach sub stage, the male will wander off in search of another female. 
### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Cubs are highly highly vocal. This makes them highly likely to be attacked. Most cubs do not make it to the 1 year old mark, thus cubs and young need to stay with their mothers for the highest level of survival. The juvi stage is all about survival. These young cubs do not tend to leave their mothers side, and call out often if she leaves and they can't find her. Once young reach the sub-adult stage they start to become more and more independent. They will start to wander away from their mother, hunting for themselves. Still learning from their mothers and still needing her protection they will remain with their mother until they are a fresh adult. 
### Solo Behavior:
Mostly mature males and mature females are the ones that are solo. Males will begin calling out in the first few days of spring to attract females. Females are very nomadic, not staying in the same place for more than 24 hours, while males tend to stick to one territory. 
### Hierarchy: 
None, but most dominate females tend to have better luck raising young, thus more attractive as a mate
### Mating:
Courting can take days, and is very challenging for the male.The male will track the female, staying at a good distance at first. He will coo at the female, make kills for her( the gifts need to be ava or bigger). Most females are very aggressive and if the male is not careful, he can find himself the main course. The female will allow him to get closer and closer to her, eventually allowing  him to brush up against her. The female will need to have the male prove to her that he can protect her, and provide for their cubs. 
### Locations Rex can be found in:
Thick trees, usually can be found around a stream or large body of water.
