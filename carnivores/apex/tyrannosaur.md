# Fears

When solo, the tyrannosaurus fears only other mated apexes. When mated with a pair, the tyrannosaurus fears no dino and is highly agressive towards other dinosaurs, in fact.

# Parental Bond

The tyrannosaurus is highly protective. Mothers will often encourage their young to fight, only taking care of the strongest, most favorable offspring. Fathers will keep a good distance from mothers and his young. Fathers will hunt and provide a strong presence to ward off other dinos. If the male spends too much time at the nest, the mother will show her teeth and show him that she needs space to grow the young.

# Early Life

Hatchlings are defenseless and will rely on their mother for protection. Hatchlings are not able to walk; they will chirp and scream for their mothers when they are ready to be unburied. 

Once the young reach the juvenile stage, they are encouraged to take on small prey as their parents are traveling. Mothers with more than one young will encourage the babies to fight so she can keep the strongest.

Females become very aggressive and dominant. Young females will start to bully younger females, or even male siblings. Once the young reach, or are close to sub-adult, the parents will begin to become distant and find little interest in caring for their young. Sub-adult females will stick around as long as possible so they can learn how to dominate a mate by watching her mother's behavior towards her father.

Sub-adult males are more likely to sneak off during the night to avoid their father's teeth.

# Solitary Behavior

Lone adult bulls are highly nomadic, they will travel the ENTIRE island in search of a mate. If two adult rexes of the same gender meetup, they will fight to the death.

Females are known to hold territory, and they will defend this territory to death. She will very rarely leave this territory unless starvation drives her to. 

If a lone rex sees a pair of any other apex, they will more than likely flee to protect themselves.

# Pack Relationships

Bulls are extremely respectful of the females space, not wanting to stay near her for too long or he may face death if not providing enough for her. When raising young, both gender are HIGHLY territorial and will not alow ANY other carnivores near.

Bulls will do most of the hunting, and try to stay in the female's good graces. Once the male has a kill, he will call the female to eat before he does.

# Hunting

Due to their size, the tyrannosaur prefers to ambush. They will stalk and hide in wait for a meal to come close enough for the rex to catch the prey within sprint distance. Bulls will protect their mate no matter the circumstance, protecting her and coming to her aid regardless of anything else.

Cows will allow the male to help, but should he ruin a hunt, or get too close, she may cannibalize him. Cows will allow the bull to show his strength, but not helping him unless he is very injured (4th screen).

# Aggression

Tyrannosaur are highly aggressive. Cows who hold territory will prioritize carnivores over herbivores. Very territorial over personal space, and cows will attack anything that comes in her territory unless it is a mated pair of other apexes.

# Breeding

Should a lone bull come into a lone cow's territory, he will approach with caution -- crouching and 2 calling, showing her that he is not a threat. If the female seems disinterested, this is the time for the bull to impress her. Trying to get her protection by hunting, protecting, and strutting for her.

When faced with a mated pair, the bull, trying to impress the female, will attempt to kill the other male using stealth and his crushing bite to win over the cow. Cows stay out of the bull fights, wanting only the strongest male to win.

Fights between bulls ALWAYS end in death, either from bull on bull fights or the female cannibalize the loser after he 4 calls the fight. If the bull shows his worth to the female, she will learn against him, cooing and crouching in front of him. 

If the cow does not like the display, she will eat him or attempt to eat him.

Some pairs stay together through winter; some pairs break off and find new mates when spring comes around.
