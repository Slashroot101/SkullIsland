### Maternal Bond:
Mothers are ruthless when it comes to protecting her young. She will kill anything that comes to close, and will move her young to keep them safe. Mothers are more likely to dote over and take care of female cubs better than male cubs. Mothers will allow their young to stay with them until they are a fresh adult, but will leave them behind after they reach this stage, and if a cub should try and stay with their mother, they may end up as their mothers next meal. Fathers are usually not a huge role in their young's life, but can often be seen hunting for them and maybe even fighting with their young. After the seasons change from Spring to summer the males will leave, and the females will go their separate ways leading any cubs they still have with them.
### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Cubs are very playful, sneaky, and energetic. Playing with their siblings, mothers, and anything they can find laying around. Cubs tend to wander off and get into trouble so their mother needs to keep a very close eye on them. Sub Adult stage is more about learning how to hunt, learning a mating dance, and becoming more independent. Once adults their mother will become aggressive towards them, kicking them out as soon as they become a fresh adult. 
### Solo Behavior:
Most of the year adults find themselves alone. Females are more likely to be found with young outside of spring, and because of this , Gigas are highly hunting for the easy meal of the young they bring. Solo they are highly stealthy and will wait for hours for something to come by for them to snatch.
### Hierarchy:
Most Dominate Male will have better luck finding breeding females, thus more likely to pass on their genes.
### Mating:
Males will maintain a territory for his whole life, and rarely leaves, and will fight for it if he thinks he can win. When he maintains a nice territory, beginning in the first days of spring, he will begin calling at dusk and throughout the night to attract females. Females will respond and will come into his territory slowly. Male gigas looking to court are highly aggressive, and if the female even slightly looks like a male giga he will kill her. The female that comes to investigate will crouch walk into an opening in his territory and coo to attract the attention of the male. The male will then come over and investigate this female. Should he like her, he will call and show her the rest of his territory. Should he not like her, he will 3 call, and some will even attack. The female will then pick the best place for the nest and the males responsibility is to keep watch of his territory and keep his mate and his young safe. Females do the hunting, teaching to the young, and protecting the young, while the male patroles.
