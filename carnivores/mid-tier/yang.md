### Maternal Bond:
Mothers will all nest together at the same time. All females will take care of all other female cubs. Females will protect their young against anything and everything that could come around. If a pride gets taken over by a new male, a female will leave the territory with her cubs to keep them safe
### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Cubs spend most of their time playing, growing, and eating. Young yangs require lots of food, so their mothers are likely to leave them behind while they hunt. They are very skittish around their fathers. When males' manes come in (crest color) their fathers will chase them off. Females are usually allowed to stay, but will be chased off or even hunted if they try to inbreed with their fathers. Mothers do not allow their daughters to mate with established males in the pride
### Solo Behavior:
They will broadcast, and mark to attract others of their kind. Females are more likely going to be accepted into a pride, while mature males will have to fight for dominance. There is allowed 2 males per pride, but these are more often brothers, or one is the winner of a fight and the winner allowed the loser to stay in the territory to help protect his females
### Hierarchy:
Most Dominate Male
### Mating:
Females are usually the ones to initiate courting. They will crouch walk, 2 call, and be very clingy around the male. Courting does not last long, but the male will protect the female's nesting grounds
### Locations Yangs can be found in:
Plains, Open areas with tall grass
