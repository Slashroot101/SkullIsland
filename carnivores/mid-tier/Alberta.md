### Adoption:
Albertas are not able to adopt
### Homosexual Behaviors:
None/Not able
### Maternal Bond:
Females are responsible solely for raising the cubs. In Spring when they are more likely to have more cubs, mothers will only want to take care of the strongest whelps and cubs. Fighting between cubs is often encouraged by their mother. Mothers will protect their cubs against any threats, but will rarely separate the cubs fighting, which can sometimes end in death
### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Cubs spend most of their time playing, growing, and eating. Young yangs require lots of food, so their mothers are likely to leave them behind while they hunt. They are very skittish around their fathers. When male young crests color their fathers will chase them off. Females are usually allowed to stay, but will be chased off or even hunted if they try to inbreed with their fathers. Mothers do not allow their daughters to mate with established males in the group
### Solo Behaviors:
They will broadcast, and mark to attract others of their kind. Females are more likely going to be accepted into a group, while mature males will have to fight for dominance. There are 2 males per group. You will be more likely to see these males in the group during spring. In fall males will part ways for the winter. If there are 2 males in the group, those 2 males will sometimes stick together during fall and winter months, sometimes they will separate
### Hierarchy:
Most dominate male
### Mating:
Females are usually the ones to initiate courting. They will begin broadcasting, rubbing on rocks and trees, and will even go ahead and pick out the area where they will place their nests. The males job is to pick the female he thinks has the best maternal skills. Since he will have no part in raising the young he needs to make sure the female he chooses in the spring will keep the next generation alive
### Locations albertas can be found in:
Thick forests, tall trees, and with a lake or body of water in the territory
