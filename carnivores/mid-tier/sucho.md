### Adoption
The Sucho is unable to adopt, due to the need to have a male and a female and males being highly likely to eat hatchlings
### Homosexual Behavior:
None/Not able
### Maternal Bond:
Mothers are very protective, they will usually lay their eggs in a mound of dirt hidden away. She will never leave her nesting site while there are still eggs. The biggest threat to her young are velos, ready for a quick meal of her eggs. The Father is long gone by this point and has little to do with this mate or the eggs
### Early Life:
 Whelps will remain inside the nest, They are still inside the egg at this point. When they grow into hatchlings (juvies), they will begin calling to their mothers from inside the nest. Their mother will come over and carry her babies to the water, where they will spend most of their lives. Their mother does not play a huge role in raising the young. It is the hatchlings responsibility to hide, and not get caught. Mother will make small kills and leave them around for her young. And should the young be in danger, they can call out to her and she will come to their aid. Hatchlings are very weary of their father, for he sees a lone young sucho as an easy meal
 ### Solo Behavior:
 Never straying far from their water source, they try not to go too long being all alone, but they will use the water ways to travel, and if they must, will travel on land at nigh
 ### Hierarchy:
 None, but biggest/oldest suchos are more respect/feared
 ### Mating:
 A Male sucho will claim a territory in fall, and guard it all year round until spring. When the frost begins to melt he will start making a bellowing call. 1 calling and 2 calling to attract a female. Females will come into investigate this male, will usually watch from the other side of his water source or will hide in thick brush. The  male will then begin swimming with his head held high in the air, 1 and 2 calling for the female(s). If the female likes the males display, and his territory she will begin dancing with him in the water, and will come onto land and make a nest. At this time, the male will call out again, hoping to attract more females. Should a male come into his territory, there will be a short fight (these usually do not end in death), the winner will get most if not all of the breeding rights to any female who may come, the other male is allowed to stay (if the winner allows), and will act as backup to the winning male in protecting the territory
 ### Locations suchos can be found in: Swamps
