### Maternal Bond:
Mothers will stock up on food, and find a soft, hidden place to lay her nest and will lay next  to the nest until her cubs emerge from the nest. She will never let her cubs out of their sight and will not allow any other pleto care for her young. Fathers are not helpful in raising the young
### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Cubs that are growing will be very adventurous. They can be found playing, calling out, and running around. As soon as the crest color comes in on the male young, the dominant male will chase him out of the territory. Females tend to stick around until they are full grown (should there be space), but will venture off when breeding season comes along
### Solo Behavior:
Males are usually the ones you find to be solo. They tend to be all grown with no bite, unless cornered
### Hierarchy:
Most Dominate Male
### Mating:
Large, older males will chase way smaller,  younger males. If a male finds a male of the same size, they will fight for dominance. Males are the ones that always initiate the courting. He will sniff the female, and if she is receptive to breeding, she will stand still. After courting, the female will venture off and place a nest, but the male will give her space and distance to raise and care for his young
### Locations Pleto can be found in:
Wooded areas, Tall Trees
