### Homosexual Behavior:
Ceratos are allowed to be in homosexual relationships, but are NOT allowed to adopt
### Maternal Bond:
Mothers have close bonds with their young, but not the closest. They are known for protecting their young fiercely, mourning them for long periods of time should a young die, and will use herself as a body bag should a threat not leave. Males have little to do with the young, and are often chased off by mothers. Mothers do not allow any other female or male near her young.
### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Cubs automatically get the status within the pack that their mother has. Higher ranking mothers, who give birth, her cubs are first cubs to be protected should a threat come close. Cubs with high ranks eat first, win more fights between siblings, and are more likely to be able to stay in the gang after adulthood. Those born to lower ranking mothers have a hard time surviving, lucky they have their mother who are likely to protect, and provide for them. Male young are the ones to die from hunger and dehydration, this is due to the fact the males have little to no hierarchy among the pack and are often left to fend for themselves after they are weaned from their mothers. Female young are well taken care of and are never allowed to leave their mothers side. Related male young are chased out of the gang as soon as their crest color comes in, Ceratos are highly against inbreeding and will even kill related males if he shows too much interest in his mother or siblings. 
### Solo Behavior:
Very skittish, and are likely to find themselves dead if they can not find a gang that will allow them to follow. 
### Hierarchy:
Females are more dominant, males listen and follow, but they have their own hierarchy within their brothers, and fathers relationships.
### Mating:
Always initiated by the male. He will approach with his head down, and soft cooing. He will sniff the female, sniff the ground where she is laying or standing and attempt to get closer to her. Should the female allow the male in her space, he will protect her from all other males while in courting. As soon as the female places a nest, he will back off and leave the female alone, while looking for the next female. 
Higher ranking males will have more luck finding a mate, but lower ranking females who can not find a mate are more likely to allow a courtship by lower ranking males
### Locations Ceratos can be found in:
Wooded areas, like the cover in swamps
