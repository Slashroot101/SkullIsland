### Maternal Bond:
Mothers raise their young alone in the small family group composed of mothers, sisters, and grandmothers. Mothers with cubs, are very protective of their young, usually not allowing any outsider near her young. Mothers will hide her young in the thick brush, and she will use her speed to get the threat away from her cubs
### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Once the cubs are big enough to come out of the home den, they will begin playing, hunting, and developing skills. Once cubs reach young adulthood they will begin to follow their mothers gang into hunts, and learn how to feed themselves. Males will be chased out when they start trying to court their family members, and female young are sometimes welcomed to stay if there is room
### Solo Behavior:
Very skittish. Solo carnos are known for being easy snacks for a stalking group of carnivores. Calling out once a day to attract others of their kind, they want to quickly find other carnos. Males are usually alone most of the year. Sometimes brothers will group up and stay together, but will separate when the need for breeding separates them
### Hierarchy:
Oldest Female in the group
### Mating:
Females will begin broadcasting,cooing, and rubbing all over trees and rocks. Putting her scent all over. If a male gets a smell of the females, he will begin making small kills, and use speed to impress the females.  The lead female will approach to investigate, if she approves the other females will come in to investigate as well. The male will only stick around when courting, when the nests are placed, he will run off and attempt to find another group of females. Females do NOT take care of the other females cubs, and will even attempt to kill another females cubs to ensure her cubs survival
### Locations Carnos can be found in:
Flat plans, and not in wooded areas
