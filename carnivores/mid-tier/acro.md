### Early Life:
Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest. Cubs are very high energy, often giving their mothers a hard time. Cubs are highly vocal, active, and nippy. Often nipping their mothers and siblings. Their mothers do not allow fighting between cubs, but female cubs are often seen fighting for dominance. Fighting between female siblings if caught by their mothers can end in serious punishment from their mother. Male young that start to show their colors will sneak off in the night, while female young often stay within their mothers territory to learn from her from afar. (young that are still with in their parent territory  are not allowed to help with any hunts
### Solo Behavior:
For some of the year, most are very comfortable being alone. In spring they will start calling out in the early morning of dawn and and just before dusk to try and attract the opposite gender.They are very bold hunters, often taking on more than they can chew, very comfortable being alone often means that they don't seek out companionship except in spring
### Hierarchy:
None
### Mating:
Once a male and a female  come together. The female starts to coo and starts to dance for her male. The male who shows interest in her will make small kills for her, and will dance by the kill he has made. Once the nest is placed the male might leave or might stay. Depends on the females aggression around her whelps
### Locations that Acros can be found in:
Thick forests, the use of some rock and thick foliage
