Whelps are born defenseless, blind, and deaf and do not leave their mothers nest.Once pups are big and old enough, their mother will take them swimming, and they will spend lots of their time in the water. Playing, splashing, and rough housing with other pups and any adult who wants to play.They will be left behind at this age, while their mother goes out and looks for food. Should they not listen to her, they could find themselves as the meal.  Once they grow into young adults, their mothers will stop following them around and they will be welcomed to follow the adults to look for food.

A male will approach female after female until he finds one that is receptive to his advances.
