Mothers who give birth to female pups are more likely to be very very strict with these pups. Male pups tend to have a little easier of a time when it comes to parents hierarchy. Mothers are very protective of their pups, and will not allow any other female around her while they are still very young. Fathers are responsible for finding food, and protecting the nesting grounds. He is constantly patrolling the ‘den’ and defending it. 
### Early Life:
As soon as pups (juvi stage) are able to walk, they begin to play fight and wrestle. Female pups are  often the subordinate, and male pups are usually more dominant. Mothers do not ever leave their pups unattended and will stay within the ‘den’ Until the pups are a fresh adult. Fathers will make a kill, call out to his mate, and then protect the food until his mate and pups get there. Male pups begin to act aggressive around food very early on, fighting their brothers for first pick. Female pups are usually the last to eat, unless their mother says otherwise. Male pups that are more dominant, may fight and even kill younger brothers if their mother is not watching close enough.  Once a young adult, their mothers defensiveness goes away, and they must learn the group hierarchy. Some may leave their home group, others will stay for life

Once the female is committed to this male she will circle him, cooing and broadcasting around him, before laying down and waiting for him to do the same. (cooing and broadcasting)
