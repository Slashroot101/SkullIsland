### The Herrerasaurus was a swift runner, and was found roaming the planet in the a late triassic period. They weight around 500kg, and were about 20 feet long. In The Isle the herrera is the fastest dinosaur in the game, and because of its smaller size, easy to hide away from preditors. It takes around 1.4 hours to grow a herrera from hatchling to full adult.

### Adoption:
The Herrera is not able to adopt due to high levels of competativeness. 
### Homosexual Behaviors:
None/not able
### Maternal Bond:
Mother Herreras only have 1 or 2 cubs per season. Female herreras will group up in late winter, early spring to mate. Females are highly possessive of cubs, and do not let other females around their young. Fathers are responsible for feeding, and defending the nesting grounds. The aggression instincts of the mothers do not really go away until the cubs are mature enough to leave them. Some mother and daughter bonds are very strong, so these two herreras will remain together. 
### Early Life:
Young cubs are often found alone, herrera parents are constantly trying to feed their young. The high energy behavior of kits means that they are always eating. As soon as cubs are born they begin to push the boundary of their parents. At all stages of development they are very cautious of danger, and usually listen if parents give a distress call. Male siblings can often be found fighting with each other, Male cubs that find themselves too hurt, may be killed by their parents. Parents do not allow sick or weak cubs in their pack. Female cubs are usually found valuable and will be more protected by the adults. Male cubs sometimes, not often, will kill less dominant cubs. This is a very important right of passage within herrera social grouping. Male cubs nearing the ‘teen’ or young adult stage will be chased out. Mothers of female cubs may choose to fight for their females cubs to be allowed to stay, but if their daughters show interest in mating with their father, their mothers will chase them out, or even kill them.
### Solo Behavior:
Very skittish. While active a lot more in the night, they can be spotted during the day. Will call mostly at night, and tend to be very relaxed and stay in the shadows during the day.
### Hierarchy:
None, but males have more respect
### Mating:
Females have a very short ‘breeding’ window. Males during this time will travel far and wide to get a chance to mate. Females will broadcast, and coo to attract the males. Females will be very picky about males, due to her short breeding. Males looking to attract a female will make small kills for her, dance for her, and pick the best spot for a nesting ground. The males, if chosen, will not stay to help raise the young. The females will raise the cubs together. Females will provide safety for other females, but will not protect other females cubs. 
### Locations velos can be found in:
Forests,tend to have rocky formations and places to hide.
