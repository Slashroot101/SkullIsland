### Early Life:
Young Austros stay in the den/nesting site until about 4 months old. Once old enough, the kits will stay near the nesting site, and tend to listen to their fathers more than their mothers. Young spend all day playing, chasing, and wrestling with each other. Some kits may be harder to keep near the nesting grounds. Kits that are more defiant will find themselves chased off, or picked on tons by their older siblings. 
### Solo Behavior:
Very skittish. Tend to hide in the shadows and never really show themselves unless they hear others of their kind. They sometimes call out at dawn and dusk, and will flee from danger. 
### Hierarchy:
None, but males tend to have more respect
### Mating:
 Females go into ‘breeding mode’ in the last couple days of winter, they will begin to coo and will begin to be ‘broody’, claiming a nesting spot, and defending it. Males who wish to mate will begin to make small kills, and coo back at the females. This can last for many hours or even days. If the female accepts him, she will bring him to her private nesting grounds. 
 ### Locations Austros can be found in:
 Forests, tend to have a territory with a small pond.
