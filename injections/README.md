# :money_with_wings: Fossil Store :money_with_wings:
Fossils can be purchased through the donation store and can be used to grow, inject, slay, skin change, and gender change your dinosaur. It is a really good way to support the server while also getting something done to your dino in return!

All fossil related transactions will go through Fossil Bot, which automates the entire process. So, you can go from donating to getting your purchase within a few minutes. There are a few rules, though:

**You only can get up to two grows, one skin change, and 2 slays per restart.**

**For all of the Fossil bot commands, you MUST be safe logged. If you are not safe logged and you run a command, you will NOT get a refund unless you have recorded evidence of what happened.**

| Command     | Video Link | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| /grow      | blah      |Grows the dinosaur of your request, whether new or from existing dino. |
| /slay      | blah | Slays your current dinosaur.      |
| /linkSteam  | blah    | Links your steam account. **This is REQUIRED to use the bot**     |
| /refer      | blah      | Refers a friend! You get fossils for doing this. |
| /skinChange      | blah      | Changes the skin of your current dino. Or grows a fresh dino with the skin you picked. |
| /bal      | blah      | Returns your fossil balance. |
| /restore      | blah      | Restores a vaulted dino. |
| /vault      | blah      | Vaults your current dinosaur allowing for later use. |
| /vaulted      | blah      | Returns a list of your vaulted dinosaurs. |
